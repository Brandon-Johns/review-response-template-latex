Dear editor and reviewers,

Thank you for your efforts in reviewing my article. I have addressed the comments to the best of my ability and updated the manuscript accordingly as detailed in this letter.

Sincerely,

Me.

\section{Reviewer \#1}
\RC This is a reviewer comment. Reviewer comments are prefixed with the command RC (reviewer comment). 

This is my response, which is formatted normally.

\RC This reviewer comment is multiple paragraphs long.

\RCC All subsequent paragraphs are prefixed with RCC (reviewer comment continued). 

My response.

\RCBlock{
	Alternatively, RCBlock can be used for reviewer comments that are multiple paragraphs long.

	RCBlock can also contain more complex typesetting.
}

\begin{RCEnv}
	The RCEnv environment is also available, if you prefer.
\end{RCEnv}

My response.

\section{Reviewer \#2}
\RC As the reviewer, I require you to change some aspect of your manuscript.

I have now changed the manuscript, as follows.

Note that the tracked changes markup can be generated automatically. See the readme for how to use the powershell script \verb|RevisionScripts/GenerateDiff.ps1| to create the tracked changes file \verb|main_diff.tex|. You can then copy paste extracts from the tracked changes file into in this file.

The optional argument of the customised quote environment is for labeling the section that the quote was extracted from. You can directly reference labels from the article, as I do here. The same ref commands can all be used: \verb|\figref|, \verb|\tbref|, \verb|\eqref|, \verb|\chapref|, \verb|\secref|, \verb|\appref|, \verb|\algoref|, \verb|\algoRefLine|, \verb|\algoRefLines|.

For any equations in the quote, the equation numbers can be made to match the article by changing the label command to \verb|\tag{\ref{}}|.

\begin{quote}[\secref{sec:ContentTypes}]
	This paragraph has mixed \DIFdel{removed} and \DIFadd{added} text.

	\DIFadd{This paragraph has been added. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text.}

	\DIFdel{This paragraph has been removed. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text. This is placeholder text.}

	This is an equation reference: \eqref{eq:myEq}.

	\begin{equation} \tag{\ref{eq:myEq}}
		\DIFadd{a = 2}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation} \tag{\ref{eq:myEq}}
		\DIFdel{a = 3}
	\end{equation}
	
	where $a$ is a variable.
\end{quote}

Alternatively, format the quote like this

\begin{quote}[Equation \ref{eq:myEq}]
	\begin{equation} \notag
		\DIFadd{a = 2}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation} \notag
		\DIFdel{a = 3}
	\end{equation}
\end{quote}

\RC Change some parts of the abstract.

I have now updated the abstract. Because the abstract does not have a label, we can just type `Abstract' as the quote origin.

\begin{quote}[Abstract]
	This paragraph from the \DIFdel{summary} \DIFadd{abstract} has been \DIFdel{modified} \DIFadd{changed}.
\end{quote}


\RC Change the wording in the figure captions because I prefer this other word.

I have now updated the figure caption.

\begin{quote}[\figref{fig:Example1} Caption]
	The figure caption has been \DIFdel{modified} \DIFadd{changed}.
\end{quote}


\RC Figure x is difficult to interpret. Make it more clear.

I have now updated the figure. To quote figures, copy only the \verb|\includegraphics| command, not the entire float environment. I also copy the caption below it.

\begin{quote}[\figref{fig:Example2}]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{Figures/ExampleFigure2.png}}
	Figure \ref{fig:Example2}: This is a very long caption that takes up multiple lines.
\end{quote}

Doing all of this is a bit of work, but keep in mind that the goal is to make it very clear exactly how you have addressed each of the reviewers comments, that you can get your work accepted without any back-and-forth. Use this template to achieve that goal.
